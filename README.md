# Audio-to-Morse-Code

Records audio through mic, then converts audio to string and converts to morse code. The morse code is then transmitted through a gpio signal connecting to an LED or vibrator, allowing deaf people to listen to people speaking through morse code! 

To run the code on rasberry pi, run the "Run.py" file and speak into the microphone. The program will then record an audio and turn it into a morse code GPIO signal which can controll an electrical component - Connect an LED for example and you should be able to listen into to someone speaking, without needing to hear them.
